Basic Blender script for converting selected 2D curve objects into SVGs.

## Usage
1. Open the scripting tab.
2. Paste in the script.
3. Change the output path and any other input arguments as needed.
4. Select the curves you want to convert and run the script.

### Some important notes:
- The curve shape must be set to 2D.
- Location, rotation, and scale transformations must be applied first.  These wouldn't be too hard to add support for but I wanted to keep things simple.

This was based on the [blender-curve-to-svg](https://github.com/aryelgois/blender-curve-to-svg) extension which no longer seems to work.
